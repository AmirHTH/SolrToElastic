# Alfresco Content Services: Solr to Elasticsearch Migration

## License

The code in this repository is released under the Apache License, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

## Preparing for Migration

### Preliminary

#### Quay.io

You should have already submitted the form for temporary Quay.io credentials. If not, you can find the instructions [here]. 

Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. You may need to run these with the `sudo` command.


### Downloading the Custom Aspects File

Currently, within the `solrToEs/01-Solr` directory, there is a file `customContentModel.xml`. Right click on this file and **Move To Trash**.

Now that you've moved the file to the trash, we need to get an updated version. 

1. Open Terminal
2. Change directories to `solrToEs/01-Solr`. This can be done by typing two separate commands:
```
cd solrToEs
cd 01-Solr
```
Alternatively, you can also press **Tab** to auto populate the filepath. 

3. Now that we're in the apropriate directory, we can pull the file from GitHub.  
```
wget https://github.com/AntonioSoler/SolrToElastic/raw/main/solrToEs/01-Solr/customContentModel.xml
```
This will download the new XML file into your 01-Solr folder. If you have issues, you can download the file directly from the GitHub project.

### Starting the Solr Environment

1. Test the Docker installation with `docker run hello-world`.
   * You may be prompted to enter the password for Administator. This is **password**.
  
2. Enter `docker login quay.io`. You will need your Quay.io credentials from earlier.
   * You will be prompted for a Username and Password. 
    
3. If this runs successfully, it's time to deploy the `01-Solr` environment.
   * Ensure you are in `solrToEs/01-Solr` directory.
  
We need to create in advance an external network to connect later Elastic's docker container with this one

```
docker network create myNetwork 
```

Then bootstrap the environment with the command:
```
docker compose up
```
The images have already been downloaded to the VMs - the containers will spin up. This may take a few minutes.

## Starting the Migration

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco WebScripts Home (admin only â€“ INTERNAL)**.
3. Select **Browse by Web Script Package**.
4. Select **/alfresco/model**.
5. Select **GET alfresco/s/model/ns-prefix-map**.

7. In the file explorer, navigate to the `solrToEs/02-ES` folder.
8. Open the **docker-compose.yml** file.
9. Edit line 69 as shown below:
   * ./re-indexing/**ModelPrefixes.json**:/opt/reindex.prefixes.json
10. Save the **docker-compose.yml** file.

### Deploying Elasticsearch

1. Open a new tab in Terminal
   * The new tab will probably open in the 'solrToEs/01-Solr` directory. You need to be in the `solrToEs/02-ES` directory. You can do this by entering these two lines separately:
     ```
     cd ..
     cd 02-ES
     ```
2. Run the command `docker compose up elasticsearch`.
3. In the Web Browser, navigate to **localhost:9200/_cat/indices**. We can confirm that Elasticsearch is running.
4. the web page should show only one line as the default database is the only one present

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
3. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Search Service**.
4. Go to the _Search Service in User_ drop-down menu and slect **Elasticsearch**.
5. Go to _Elasticsearch Hostname_ and name it **elasticsearch**.
6. Click _Save_.
7. Refresh the page and select **Test Connection**. This should be successful.
8. Navigate to **localhost:9200/_cat/indices**. There will be a new index created "Alfresco" value (2 lines shown).

### Re-Indexing

1. Open a new tab in Terminal. This should still be in the `solrToEs/02-ES` directory.
2. Run the command `docker compose up re-indexing`.
3. This will exit with **Code 0**. Nothing to worry about - it means it was successful.
4. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
5. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
6. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Node Browser**.
7. Select _Query_.
8. Select **fts.alfresco** from the drop-down menu.
9. Execute a search for **yml**.

### Live Indexing

1. In the terminal, ensure you are in the `solrToEs/02-ES`.
2. Run the command `docker compose up live-indexing`.
3. Open the Web Broswer and navigate to **localhost:8080/workspace**.
4. Select **Custom Personal Files**.
5. Select **Shared**.
6. Select the **Aspects** folder.
7. Select **Upload**.
8. Within the File Explorer, upload **solrToEs.zip**.

### Testing Elasticsearch Live Indexing

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
3. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Node Browser**.
4. Go to _Query_
5. Select **fts-alfresco** from the drop-down menu.
6. Execute a search for **zip**. You should see the **solrToEs.zip** file - confirming that the Solr to Elasticsearch migration has occured successfully.

We can do one more test to confirm that Solr is no longer indexing.

1. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Search Service**.
2. In _Search Service in Use_, select **Solr6** from the drop-down menu.
3. Click _Save_.
4. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Node Browser**.
5. Go to _Query_
6. Select **fts-alfresco** from the drop-down menu.
7. Execute a search for **zip**. You will no longer see the **solrToEs.zip** file.

Follow steps 1-3, but switch to Elasticsearch to move back to your newly migrated and configured search service! Congratulations!
