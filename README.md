# Alfresco Content Services: Solr to Elasticsearch Migration

## License

The code in this repository is released under the Apache License, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

## Preparing for Migration

### Preliminary

#### Quay.io

You should have already submitted the form for temporary Quay.io credentials. If not, you can find the instructions [here]. 

Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. You may need to run these with the `sudo` command.


### Downloading the project

1. Open Terminal
2. we can pull the file from GitHub.  
```
wget https://github.com/AntonioSoler/SolrToElastic/raw/main/solrToEs.zip
```
This will download the new zip file into your folder, then use:

```
unzip solrToEs.zip
```

If you have issues, you can download the entire repository from GitHub project.

https://github.com/AntonioSoler/SolrToElastic

### Starting the Solr Environment

1. Test the Docker installation with `docker run hello-world`.
  
2. Enter `docker login quay.io`. You will need your Quay.io credentials from earlier.
   * You will be prompted for a Username and Password. 
    
3. If this runs successfully, it's time to deploy the `01-Solr` environment.
   * Ensure you are in `solrToEs/01-Solr` directory.
  
We need to create in advance an external network to connect later Elastic's docker container with this one

```
docker network create myNetwork 
```

Then bootstrap the environment with the command:
```
docker compose up
```
The images will download if you correctly entered the credentials to quay

## Starting the Migration

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco WebScripts Home (admin only â€“ INTERNAL)**.
3. Select **Browse by Web Script Package**.
4. Select **/alfresco/model**.
5. Select **GET alfresco/s/model/ns-prefix-map**.

   >>Note This is a custom jar that is added to to the YML file to generate the prefix map, review the content of the yml file to see how to use it in the furure
   
7. Highlight and copy this text.
   * Open the _Text Editor_ and paste this text here or from the browser select "Save as"
   * Save the document as **ModelPrefixes.json** to the `solrToEs/02-ES/re-indexing` folder. (

8. In the file explorer, navigate to the `solrToEs/02-ES` folder.
9. Open the **docker-compose.yml** file.
10. Edit line 69 as shown below:
   * ./re-indexing/**ModelPrefixes.json**:/opt/reindex.prefixes.json
11. Save the **docker-compose.yml** file.
12. edit the **solrToEs/02-ES/re-indexing/mediation-filter.yml**
13. we want to exclude the Confidential files from the indexing so we need to add the confidential Aspect after line 6 and insert the line
```
   - lisbon:ConfidentialAspec
```

### Deploying Elasticsearch

1. Open a new tab in Terminal
   * The new tab will probably open in the `solrToEs/01-Solr` directory. You need to be in the `solrToEs/02-ES` directory. You can do this by entering these two lines separately:
     ```
     cd ..
     cd 02-ES
     ```
2. Run the command `docker compose up elasticsearch`.
3. In the Web Browser, navigate to **localhost:9200/_cat/indices**. We can confirm that Elasticsearch is running.
4. the web page should show only one line as the default database is the only one present

>> Note that we have set the `alfresco` index to be created by default in [alfresco compose.yaml](https://github.com/AntonioSoler/SolrToElastic/blob/main/solrToEs/01-Solr/docker-compose.yml#L55C9-L55C52) file, on a production deployment you may [create the index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) in Elasticsearch by yourself applying recommended settings, like clustering policies.

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
3. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Search Service**.
4. Go to the _Search Service in User_ drop-down menu and select **Elasticsearch**.
5. Go to _Elasticsearch Hostname_ and name it **elasticsearch**.
6. Click _Save_.
7. Refresh the page and select **Test Connection**. This should be successful.
8. Navigate to **localhost:9200/_cat/indices**. There will be a new index created "Alfresco" value (2 lines shown).
9. Change the default **Transactional query option** of both FTS and CMIS search modes from "Use Database if posssible" to "Never use the database" 

>>>NOTE this is for the purpouse of the course to demonstrate that the confidential files are not excluded from Elastic indexing, in the future you may want to have it enabled


### Cross-locale configuration

If you need cross locale configuration, add your configuration before starting the indexing process, as described in [Alfresco documentation](https://docs.alfresco.com/search-enterprise/latest/config/#exact-term-search). By default this configuration is [disabled](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-enterprise-repo/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/search/elasticsearch/config/exactTermSearch.properties).

### Re-Indexing

>> Verify the different options to index metadata, content and path before re-indexing, as described in [Alfresco Documentation](https://docs.alfresco.com/search-enterprise/latest/admin/#enabling-and-disabling-re-indexing-features-recommendations)

1. Open a new tab in Terminal. This should still be in the `solrToEs/02-ES` directory.
2. Run the command `docker compose up re-indexing`.
3. This will exit with **Code 0**. Nothing to worry about - it means it was successful.
4. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
5. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
6. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Node Browser**.
7. Select _Query_.
8. Select **fts-alfresco** from the drop-down menu.
9. Execute a search for **yml**.

>> If progress monitoring is required, [parallel reindexing](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-blog/alfresco-search-enterprise-3-2-deploying-at-scale/ba-p/316047) is recommended. This process is relying in [Spring Batch](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/scalability.html) framework, that provides all the information related to the process. Note that an additional database, dedicated to this parallel reindexing process is required in this use case.

### Live Indexing

1. In the terminal, ensure you are in the `solrToEs/02-ES`.
2. Run the command `docker compose up live-indexing`.
3. Verify in the ActiveMQ Web Console http://localhost:8161 (password is admin:admin )the search queues have been created:
```
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.content.event
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.contentrefresh.event
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.contentstore.event
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.metadata.event
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.metadata.retry.event
QUEUE	org.alfresco.search.path.event
```
4. Open the Web Broswer and navigate to **localhost:8080/workspace**.
5. Select **Custom Personal Files**.
6. Select **Shared**.
7. Select the **Aspects** folder.
8. Select **Upload**.
9. Within the File Explorer, upload **solrToEs.zip**.

### Testing Elasticsearch Live Indexing

1. Navigate to **localhost:8080/alfresco**.
2. Select **Alfresco Administration Console (admin only)**.
   * The User/Password is admin/admin
3. In the Left Navigation Panel, select **Node Browser**.
4. Go to _Query_
5. Select **fts-alfresco** from the drop-down menu.
6. Execute a search for **zip**. You should see the **solrToEs.zip** file - confirming that the Solr to Elasticsearch migration has occured successfully.



### tail-Indexing

In the event that some unexpected event happens during the server operation there is the option to reindex a range of dates using the reindexing component with different parameters

you can verify the status of the health of the index in the admin console in the **seach service** page, switch to the service status tab 

You can see the configuration in **the docker-compose.yml** file in the section  **tail-re-rendexing**

1. Open a new tab in Terminal. This should still be in the `solrToEs/02-ES` directory.
2. Run the command `docker compose up tail-re-indexing`.
3. This will exit with **Code 0**. Nothing to worry about - it means it was successful.

Follow steps 1-3, but switch to Elasticsearch to move back to your newly migrated and configured search service! Congratulations!
